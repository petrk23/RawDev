This directory contains data for test purposes.

The dataset is very large, so I decided to leave the directory
intentionally empty. Otherwise, it would mess up the repository
with these large binary files, which are not needed to build
the software.

Where to get camera RAW files?
------------------------------
As I cannot own all these cameras, I must rely on other sources.
One source is [imaging-resource](https://www.imaging-resource.com/).
So special thanks, as they made it possible to test files from
a variety of different professional cameras.
